# architechturalNotes

<li> The main purpose of this application I developed for architects is to create a drawing draft by taking notes along with a photo in order to later make a professional design. </li>
<li> In this application, I used coredata, a feature of iOS, as the database. </li>
<li> After adding data to coredata and completing the calling functions, I started designing the interface. </li>
<li> After designing a details interface to later examine the data we added, I finished my application by adding small details. </li>
